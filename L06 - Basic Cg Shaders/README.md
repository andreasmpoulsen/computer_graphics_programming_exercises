# Exercises - Basic Cg Shaders

## Task 1 - Minimal Shader and Vectors:

[Tutorial for a minimal shader](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity/Minimal_Shader)  
[Wiki entry for Vector and Matrix Operations](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Vector_and_Matrix_Operations)

1. Assume yellow light (e.g. float3(1.0,1.0,0.0)) illuminates a surface of greenish gray (e.g. float3(0.5,0.7,0.5)). Write a shader that computes and outputs the resulting color.
2. Use the 4 components of vertexPos and construct a new 4D vector variable with them. Use the new 4D vector variable in the vertex shader instead of vertexPos.

## Task 2 - RGB Cube:

[Tutorial](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity/RGB_Cube)

1. Follow the tutorial to implement the shader.
2. Change the color to gray as described in the tutorial.
3. Implement a subtractive CMY cube as described in the tutorial.

## Task 3 - Debugging of Shaders

[Tutorial](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity/Debugging_of_Shaders)

1. Follow the tutorial to implement the shader and test it with a few shapes and attributes.
2. Answer the questions in the section “Debugging Practice”.

## Task 4 - Shading in World Space

[Tutorial](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity/Shading_in_World_Space)

1. Follow the tutorial to implement shader properties and a C# script to set the shader properties based on another object.
